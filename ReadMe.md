# Semantic_Search
The AI semantic search project utilizes advanced algorithms to comprehend user queries and provide relevant results from a vast database. With its ability to understand context and meaning, it offers an enhanced search experience and saves time by delivering accurate results in seconds. 

For this project I have used Stackoverflow questions dataset which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yugal123/stackoverflow

# Description
